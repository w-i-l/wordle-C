<h1>Wordle solver</h1>
<h3>This is the translation for the <a href='https://github.com/w-i-l/ASM-Project'>Wordle solver in Python</a></a></h3>

<hr/>

<h2>How to use it</h2>
<p>All you need to is to call a function depends on what you want to do:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the <b>one_word</b> function choose a random word from the list and solve it, the result is display in console</li>
    <li>the <b>test_all</b> function runs every word and save the result in a file alone with the average tries per word and the time </li>
    <li>if you wish to try a certain word, all you need to do is to change the <b>random_word</b> from the <b>one_word</b> function into your number index from the word list</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<ol>
    <li>It reads all the world from the file and store them into an array</li>
    <li>Compute the entropy for every word and find the most "valuable" word, from the perspective of information given</li>
    <li>Remove the words that doesn't fit with the pattern generated by the best word found earlier</li>
    <li>And keeps looping the step 2. and 3. until the pattern is fully green.</li>
</ol>
